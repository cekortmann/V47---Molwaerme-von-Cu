\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Ziel}

In this experiment we want to measure the specific molar heat of copper in dependence of the temperature. Therefore, we look at three 
different models to describe the dependence on temperature of the molar heat. Besides that we will calculate the Debye temperature
$\theta_{\symup{D}}$.
